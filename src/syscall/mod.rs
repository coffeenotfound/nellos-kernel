//! amd64 syscall implementation (using syscall/sysret)
//! 
//! [`syscall_entry_long0`] is the syscall entry stored into `LSTAR`.
//! 
//! Note that we are saving all 16 gprs since they are either
//! sysv64 callee-saved (and thus we want to preserve them anyways),
//! are syscall arguments (including rax) or are rcx and r11 which
//! we also need to save. In fact every single reg except r10
//! we strictly need to preserve so we might as well preserve all of them,
//! with the exception of rcx and r11 which we technically cannot preserve
//! and are therefore cleared upon sysret.
//! 
//! Steps of a syscall
//! * User sets up arguments in the proper registers
//! * User execs syscall
//! * ...
//! * GS is swapped to grant access to per-cpu kernel data
//! * Stack is switched to kernel stack
//! * User regs are saved to the kernel stack (having made sure not to
//!   clobber any regs in the process!)
//!   TODO: Maybe either use direct segment addressing `[cs:...]` or maybe use one reg like r10 as a scratch reg that is also not preserved?
//! * Syscall is serviced
//! * TODO: Syscall return values get stored into return regs
//! * GS segment is swapped back
//! * User regs are restored (including rbp and rsp, restoring the user stack)
//! * sysret is executed

// TODO: Figure out the best way of having arch specific functionality
//  in top level modules (like syscall, mem, proc) instead of the arch
//  submodules (or maybe that *is* the best option, I dunno, figure it out!)
